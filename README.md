The aim of the application is to test learners' knowledge. By detecting learners who are cheating. <br>
The current project is version 2 of [NoGPT Quizz](https://github.com/Oomaxime/NOGPT-QUIZZ), which is **currently under development**. <br>
I've taken over the old version that I and my group worked on. <br> I took over the project alone but maybe a few people could join me (there's a lot of work to be done). <br>There are a lot of changes to be made and the project is pretty interesting, especially in a world where AI is advancing at a rapid pace. <br>
The new design is still being created, but for the moment I'm concentrating on the back-end, which has too many small problems. 

### To launch the project: 
1) clone the repo
2) cd Project
3) npm i 
4) npm start 
5) you can test going on different routes:
